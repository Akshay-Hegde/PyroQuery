h1. PyroQuery

Allows you to make MySQL queries in layouts and output the resulting data.

h2. Installation

Drop the query.php file into your _addons/plugins_ folder.

h2. Usage

{pyro:query:run query="SELECT * FROM table"}
	{field_name}
{/pyro:query:run}

Simple provide your query as the *query* parameter, and the plugin will make all the fields returned by your query available as variables.

In addition, PyroQuery returns two special variables:

h3. {query.odd_even}

Returns "odd" or "even" based on the row being displayed.

h3. {query.last_row}

Returns "yes" or "no" based on whether the row being displayed is the last one.
